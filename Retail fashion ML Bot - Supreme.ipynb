    "# Retail Fashion ML/AI Bot - Supreme - Python Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Though seems like a different world if You are into fashion, skateboarding, motorcycles, music and generally street culture its likely that You know how important is 11:00am on Thursdays, 11:00 on Tuesdays and Sundays drop reveals. Supreme is #1 brand right now and their online drops sell out in matter of seconds. Here are some statistics: US, Europe and Japan.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been following and participating in community in various ways and it never ceases to amaze me, especially the people who are into it and amount of energy that flows when coping on Lafayette in Manhattan or wherever You are. And this is my way of giving back. I've used this bot for at least 10 times over the past 2-3 months, and its able to buy in under 2 seonds, so no matter how hyped good is, I am sure You can also get it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Specify what items You want based on category, name, color and size (check drop reveals on www.supremecommunity.com)\n",
    "1. Monitor www.supremenewyork.com for a change in products on 11:00 Thursday based on epoch (usually its on time, but not always, so have another check like number of unique links in 2-3 categories)\n",
    "2. Get all the links in category You look for (BeutifulSoup ftw!)\n",
    "3. Match the name, color and size of item You look for (pythonic way!)\n",
    "4. Get it into cart (Selenium!)\n",
    "5. Checkout (pay!)\n",
    "6. Be cool, be supreme ;)\n",
    "\n",
    "For people not into programming here is a simple windows and linux/mac application that You can download."
